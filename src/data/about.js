export const about = `Hello, I am Panagiotis Berovalis and I am a web developer. I spend most of my day creating apps using HTML, CSS and Javascript, while experimenting with the lastest technologies and frameworks available. My basic fullstack training was at FreeCodeCamp, where I successfully completed the entire curriculum, approximately 1800 hours of coursework in 6 months. Currently I am trying Bootstrap 5, Deno.js and I am working my way to the basic tier certification of AWS (CLF-C01).`
